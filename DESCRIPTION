Description: An implementation of feature selection, weighting and ranking via simultaneous perturbation
    stochastic approximation (SPSA). The SPSA-FSR algorithm searches for a locally optimal set of
    features that yield the best predictive performance using some error measures such as mean 
    squared error (for regression problems) and accuracy rate (for classification problems).
