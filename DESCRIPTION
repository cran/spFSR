Description: An implementation of feature selection and ranking via simultaneous perturbation
    stochastic approximation (SPSA-FSR) based on works by V. Aksakalli and M. Malekipirbazari 
    (2015) <arXiv:1508.07630> and Zeren D. Yenice and et al. (2018) <arXiv:1804.05589>.
    The SPSA-FSR algorithm searches for a locally optimal set of features that yield the best 
    predictive performance using a specified error measure such as mean squared error (for 
    regression problems) and accuracy rate (for classification problems). This package requires 
    an object of class 'task' and an object of class 'Learner' from the 'mlr' package.
